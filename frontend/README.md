## ü§ñ Sophie - AI Dental Assistant Chatbot

### Architecture & Logic

Sophie is a GPT-4 powered conversational AI designed to guide patients through their dental journey using the Socratic method of selling - asking thoughtful questions to help patients discover their own needs.

#### Core Components

1. **Conversation Engine** (`/src/chatbot/`)
   - **GPT-4 Integration**: Leverages OpenAI's latest model for natural, context-aware conversations
   - **State Management**: Uses Zustand for maintaining conversation state, booking intent, and user preferences
   - **Conversation Flow**: Implements a sophisticated flow system that adapts based on user responses

2. **Booking Intent Detection**
   - Tracks user engagement through conversation patterns
   - Progressively increases booking intent score (0-100%) based on:
     - Questions asked about procedures
     - Interest in pricing/financing
     - Scheduling inquiries
     - Pain points discussed
   - Visual progress indicator shows journey toward booking

3. **Socratic Selling Methodology**
   - Instead of pushing services, Sophie asks questions like:
     - "How long have you been experiencing this discomfort?"
     - "What would your ideal smile look like?"
     - "Have you considered how this might affect your daily life?"
   - Builds trust through empathetic responses
   - Educates while discovering patient needs

4. **Knowledge Base Integration**
   - Comprehensive information about all procedures
   - Real-time answers about insurance, financing, and scheduling
   - Contextual suggestions based on conversation history

### Key Features

- **Multi-stage Conversations**: Remembers context throughout the session
- **Financing Integration**: Ready for real-time approval checks with CareCredit/LendingClub APIs
- **Smart Suggestions**: Offers relevant quick responses based on conversation stage
- **Emotional Intelligence**: Adapts tone based on user's emotional state
- **Appointment Readiness**: Seamlessly transitions to booking when intent is high

### Technical Implementation

```typescript
// Conversation flow example
const analyzeIntent = (message: string, history: Message[]) => {
  // GPT-4 analyzes message in context
  // Returns intent score, suggested responses, and next actions
  return {
    bookingIntent: calculateBookingReadiness(message, history),
    suggestedResponses: generateContextualSuggestions(message),
    shouldShowFinancing: detectFinancingInterest(message)
  };
};
```
