### **The "Staten Island Smile Project" Campaign**

This campaign positions the dentist not just as a service provider, but as a local technology leader dedicated to improving the health and confidence of Staten Island residents. The "project" framing feels exclusive and community-oriented.

### **Phase 1: The Foundation - The "Hook" and The "Hub"**

Before you find people, you need a compelling reason for them to give you their contact info and a place for them to do it.

**1. The "Hook": The Free Robotic Implant Assessment**
This is your primary offer. It's not just a "free consultation." It's a high-value, tech-focused assessment that includes:
*   A 3D CBCT scan.
*   A digital "Smile Simulation" showing their potential new smile.
*   A personalized assessment of their suitability for a Yomi-guided procedure.
*   **Value Proposition:** "See your future smile with robotic precision, for free, with no obligation."

**2. The "Hub": A Dedicated Microsite**
Do not send traffic to the main dental practice website. Create a simple, elegant, one-page website with a URL like **StatenIslandRoboticImplants.com** or **YomiStatenIsland.com**. This site will contain:
*   **Headline:** "The Future of Dental Implants is in Staten Island."
*   **Video:** A professionally shot 90-second video featuring the dentist explaining the Yomi robot in simple, powerful terms (less pain, perfect precision, faster recovery). Show the robot in a non-intimidating way.
*   **Simple Explanation:** Graphics showing the difference between traditional vs. robotic implant surgery.
*   **Social Proof:** Testimonials (video if possible) from existing patients.
*   **The Form:** A prominent, simple form to "Claim Your Free Robotic Implant Assessment." Fields: First Name, Email, Phone Number.

### **Phase 2: Hyper-Targeted Digital Outreach**

This is how you find the right people online.

**1. "Dental Pain" Keyword Targeting (Google & Bing Ads)**
*   **Keywords:** Go beyond "dental implants staten island." Target intent-driven keywords:
    *   "cost of dentures vs implants"
    *   "my bridge failed what are my options"
    *   "emergency dentist staten island"
    *   "sore gums from dentures"
    *   "best tooth replacement options"
*   **Ad Copy:** "Tired of Denture Pain? See a Permanent Solution with Robotic Precision. Free Yomi Assessment in Staten Island."

**2. Facebook/Instagram "Lookalike" & Interest Targeting**
This is where the creativity comes in. You're not just targeting by age.
*   **Create a "Lookalike Audience":** Upload the email list of your *existing* implant patients (and other patients over 50). Facebook will find new people in Staten Island who share their characteristics. This is incredibly powerful.
*   **Targeting by Affluence & Life Events:**
    *   **Location:** Target specific affluent zip codes in Staten Island (e.g., 10301, 10304, 10312, 10314).
    *   **Interests:** Target users interested in: Golf, Country Clubs, Luxury Travel, Boating, Lincoln Center, AARP, Financial Planning services. This captures an audience with disposable income.
    *   **Behaviors:** Target users who have recently engaged with "Health & Wellness" products.
*   **Ad Creative:** Use video ads showing patient success stories. "From hiding my smile to non-stop compliments. See how it happened."

**3. The "Digital Neighborhood Watch" on Nextdoor & Facebook Groups**
*   **Nextdoor:** Run ads on the local neighborhood platform. The tone should be helpful, not salesy. "A Staten Island Dentist is offering a free educational seminar on new robotic implant technology."
*   **Facebook Groups:** Identify and join groups for Staten Island communities, seniors, and local businesses. Don't spam them. Engage authentically and have the practice's page share a helpful blog post or video about the technology, inviting questions.

### **Phase 3: High-Touch, Old-School & Community-Based Outreach**

This builds trust and captures people who aren't online.

**1. The "Golden Ticket" Direct Mailer**
*   Forget flimsy postcards. Design a high-quality, oversized, sealed envelope that looks like an exclusive invitation.
*   **Inside:** A personalized letter on heavy card stock. "Dear [Name], Our practice, [Practice Name], has been selected to be the exclusive provider of Yomi Robotic Dental Implants in Staten Island. As a valued member of our community, we would like to invite you to receive a complimentary Robotic Implant Assessment..."
*   **Mailing List:** Purchase a mailing list for Staten Island residents, ages 55-75, with an estimated household income over $100k. This is highly targeted and effective.

**2. Strategic Alliances with Other Health Professionals**
*   **The Target:** General Physicians, Cardiologists, and Endocrinologists in Staten Island. Poor oral health is linked to heart disease and diabetes.
*   **The Offer:** Provide them with a "prescription pad" that is actually a referral slip for the "Free Robotic Implant Assessment."
*   **The Pitch:** "Many of your patients suffer from issues related to tooth loss. We can be a resource. Our new robotic technology is minimally invasive, making it a safer option for many patients, including those you treat."

**3. Host an "Educational Wine & Cheese Evening"**
*   Host a small, exclusive, in-person event at the practice after hours.
*   **The Topic:** "Robots, Wine, and Your Smile: A Look at the Future of Dentistry."
*   **The Invitation:** Promote it through all the channels above (Facebook Events, Direct Mail, Email list). This is a high-conversion-rate event. You capture their full contact info upon RSVP and build a strong personal connection at the event itself.

### **Phase 4: The "White Glove" Nurturing & Conversion Funnel**

Getting a name and number is only the start. The goal now is to convert that interest into a scheduled, high-value patient. This requires a sophisticated, high-touch follow-up system.

**1. The Immediate Response Protocol (The First 2 Hours)**
*   **The Role:** This call should not come from a generic "receptionist." It should be from a "Yomi Patient Coordinator" or "Technology Advocate"â€”a title that conveys expertise and care.
*   **The Script's Goal:** Not to sell, but to *confirm and comfort*.
    *   *"Hi [Lead's Name], this is [Coordinator's Name] from [Dentist's Practice]. I'm the patient coordinator for the Yomi Robotic System. I'm calling because you just requested your free robotic implant assessment online. I wanted to personally reach out to find a comfortable time for you and answer any initial questions you might have about the technology. Are you free to talk for a minute?"*
*   **Key Elements:**
    *   **Acknowledge the Technology:** Mention "Yomi" and "robotic" to reinforce the high-tech value.
    *   **Remove Friction:** Offer flexible scheduling.
    *   **Pre-Qualify Gently:** "Just so we can prepare for your visit, could you tell me a little bit about what prompted you to look into a more permanent solution for your teeth?"

**2. The Automated Nurturing Sequence (For Leads Who Don't Book Immediately)**
If they don't book on the first call, they enter an automated email and SMS sequence. The goal is to build trust and stay top-of-mind by providing value, not pestering them.

*   **Day 1 (Email): "Here's What to Expect at Your Robotic Assessment."**
    *   A friendly email with a link to the video from the microsite. It demystifies the process and reduces anxiety.
*   **Day 3 (Email): "Patient Story: From Dentures to Dining with Confidence."**
    *   A powerful, written testimonial with a high-quality photo (or video) of a happy patient. Storytelling is more effective than statistics.
*   **Day 7 (Email): "The 3 Biggest Myths About Dental Implants."**
    *   An educational piece that busts common myths (e.g., "It's a painful, lengthy process"). This positions the practice as a trusted expert and subtly highlights how the Yomi robot solves these very issues.
*   **Day 10 (SMS): A Personal, Low-Pressure Text.**
    *   *"Hi [Lead's Name], it's [Coordinator's Name] again. Just wanted to see if you had any questions about the Yomi system. Feel free to text me back here. No pressure at all."*

### **Phase 5: Amplification & Long-Term Authority**

This phase turns the initial campaign into a sustainable marketing engine that continuously builds the practice's reputation.

**1. Local PR: The "Hometown Tech Story"**
A dental practice investing in a surgical robot is a legitimate news story for a local market.
*   **Action:** Write a professional press release.
*   **Headline:** "Staten Island Dentist First in Borough to Offer Advanced Robotic Dental Surgery."
*   **Angle:** Frame it as a story of local investment, bringing "Manhattan-level technology" to Staten Island residents.
*   **Distribution:** Send it directly to journalists at the *Staten Island Advance*, NY1 News, and local community blogs. Follow up with a phone call. One good news story provides incredible third-party validation.

**2. Content That Creates Patients: The "Answer Everything" Strategy**
Turn the practice's expertise into a library of content that attracts new patients for free over the long term.
*   **Create a Video/Blog Series:** "The Staten Island Guide to a Perfect Smile."
    *   Answer every conceivable question a potential patient might have.
    *   **Topics:** "How much do implants *really* cost in NYC?", "What's the recovery time for robotic implants?", "Am I too old for dental implants?", "What foods can I eat after implant surgery?".
    *   **Format:** Short, 2-3 minute videos of the dentist explaining it clearly. Post on YouTube, the microsite, and share on social media. The transcripts become blog posts.
*   **Create a Downloadable PDF Guide:** "The Consumer's Guide to Robotic Dental Implants." Offer this on the website as a secondary lead magnet for those not ready for a full assessment.

**3. The "Lunch & Learn" Referral Program**
Deepen the strategic alliances with other medical professionals.
*   **The Offer:** The dentist or Patient Coordinator offers to bring a catered lunch to a physician's office in exchange for 15 minutes of their time.
*   **The Presentation:** A quick, professional presentation on how poor oral health impacts systemic health (diabetes, heart disease) and how the minimally-invasive Yomi robot is a safer, better option for their at-risk patients.
*   **The Leave-Behind:** A high-quality referral kit with a dedicated phone number for physician referrals.
